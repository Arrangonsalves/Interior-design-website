The "home.html" is the 1st page and everything else is connected to this page.

I suggest you not to open the website from here instead copy this folder to workspace in
visual studio(recommended) and run the file.

If the page shows error or css error please check the href links because it will give error
because the file location isn't same in your pc as in mine.



Thank you....
