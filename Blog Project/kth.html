                <h3>Acrylic Kitchen Cabinets For Indian Kitchens</h3>
                <img src="kth-5.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>Ever since the idea of having a modular kitchen became popular in India wood and glass have been the most preferred choice of material for homeowners for their kitchen cabinetry. However, with advancements in technology, a plethora of chic and long-lasting materials and finishes like commercial plywood sheets, MDF, laminate, and acrylic topped the interior design charts in the market. Among the various finishes, acrylic kitchen cabinets have become quite popular, mainly due to its glossy surface, durability, and cost. This material also makes cabinets look expensive and sleek.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>What Are Acrylic Kitchen Cabinets?</h3>
                <img src="kth-6.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>Acrylic is an artificial plastic that is commonly used to give a glossy finish to modern kitchen cabinets. They offer a scratch-resistant lustrous finish to the cabinet surfaces and make a chic statement. Acrylic kitchen cabinet doors are either made out of hardwood or MDF board and then protected with a cover of acrylic sheets in the preferred colour and pattern to get the desired finish.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>What Are The Types And Price Of Acrylic Kitchen Cabinets?</h3>
                <img src="kth-7.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>Acrylic kitchen cabinets can be categorised in mainly two types –those with solid acrylic doors and cabinets with acrylic finished doors. Cabinets with solid acrylic doors usually are priced slightly higher as they are made entirely of acrylic. This means such doors have an even colour display that makes them look vibrant.  Cabinets with acrylic finished doors are budget-friendly or economic. The process of using this acrylic finish to kitchen cabinet doors is a complex one where acrylic sheets are pasted on an MDF board as the base material.</p>

                <h3>Standard Dimensions to Design Your Kitchen</h3>
                <img src="kth-8.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>Over the last few years, kitchens have grown from carpenter made (or civil kitchens) with basic cabinetry and countertops to extraordinarily sleek and functional modular kitchen designs. While modular kitchens are extremely functional and modern, if not designed and planned properly, can spoil your cooking experience. Right dimensions play an important role in designing a functional kitchen as they help you place every element in the correct place and direction. While engineers have spent several years perfecting the right standard dimensions to design a kitchen   our team of designers at Design Cafe have mastered the art of designing ergonomic kitchens with the right dimensions. A well designed kitchen with proper dimensions helps avoid unnatural postures and gives you a hassle-free cooking experience.</p>

                <h3>The Golden Triangle Rule</h3>
                <img src="kth-9.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>The golden triangle rule says that the preparation slab (sink), the storage unit (refrigerator), cooking range, (stove), must be installed within a gap of four-nine feet. The sink, stove, and refrigerator are the focal points of the kitchen and therefore need to be placed strategically. It is wise to place your stove and refrigerator opposite each other with the sink in the centre — forming a tentative triangle. Consider little details like putting your frequently used appliances closer to the refrigerator to make this golden triangle far more user-friendly. Do remember, segregate and bundle everything as per the functionality.</p>
