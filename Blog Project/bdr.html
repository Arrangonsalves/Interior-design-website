                <h3>Four Poster Bed Design Ideas For Your Bedroom</h3>
                <img src="bdr-1.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>Let’s get into a bit of history before we go mainstream. Four-poster beds were invented in the early 13th century and are now commonly known as canopy beds. Royal families used these beds in their castles. Back in the day instead of beams supporting curtains they supported fur to maintain privacy and also keep people warm when they were in bed. We all know castles back then were cold and not really like modern homes.</p>

                <h3>DIY Headboard Ideas For Your Bedroom</h3>
                <img src="bdr-5.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>Regardless of the style – eclectic, traditional or industrial – your headboard can become a focal point of your bedroom. Picking the perfect headboard is a crucial task — but that doesn’t imply your choice is limited to a showroom’s catalogue.A headboard can bring a significant impact to a bedroom’s aesthetic no matter what it’s size is. In a large bedroom a headboard fills the space. On the other hand, in a small bedroom a headboard makes the bed feel special without taking up a lot of space. While there are several designs of headboards to choose from, nothing can beat a DIY personalised headboard!</p>
                <br>
                <h3>DIY Wooden Headboard Design</h3>
                <img src="bdr-6.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>This one tops our list mainly because it’s easy to create and extremely economical! All you need to create this DIY wooden headboard is plywood, some nails and a hammer. Carefully place the plywood sheet at the back of your bed and fix it well by hammering the nails onto the bed rim. If you have a metal bed, you can simply place the plywood sheet behind the bed. And there you have a simple headboard ready! You can paint it in any of your favourite bold colours to match your bedroom interiors.</p>

                <h3>DIY Rustic Style Headboard Design</h3>
                <img src="bdr-7.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>If you love the idea of a rustic styled bedroom and want a headboard design that blends in perfectly, this one’s for you! To create this design yourself, pick a plywood sheet, a rectangular-shaped wooden tabletop or wooden panels and paste it symmetrically. Now paint it with a coat of varnish or commonly known as wood polish .This will help get rid of chips/splinters and will highlight the wooden texture with a subtle shine. Once it’s dried, you can fix it onto the rim of your bed with nails or place it behind the head as shown in this image here.</p>

                <h3>Paint A Headboard!</h3>
                <img src="bdr-8.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>This will need some effort. Yes it will. But we aren’t going to make you paint your whole headboard.  You need to only work on the laser level that covers the head rim of the bed. Use a bold two-tone colour palette, a solid colour or an elegant amalgamation of contrasting colours forming a pattern as shown in this image. A painted portion will create an illusion of a headboard without taking up additional space.</p>
