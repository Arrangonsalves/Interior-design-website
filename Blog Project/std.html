                <h3>Sssshh! Here’s A Great Mind At Work: Peaceful Study Room Designs!</h3>
                <img src="std-1.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>If you’re having difficulty completing your office tasks because of children running around or music blaring then it’s time to get yourself a study room. A private home office where you can focus on your work. You do not need a large space for a study room. You can redesign a small space in your home and turn it into a study room, even if it’s in your bedroom. Regardless of the size or space, you can still design an affordable study room. Here are a bunch of smart study room designs for your home.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>A Peaceful Study Room Needs A Built-In Desk</h3>
                <img src="std-2.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>If you space constraints then a built-in desk will do wonders. It is a real space saver. Depending on your spatial desires, you can design a desk with multiple drawers, shelves, and compartments to store documents. If you are someone who works a lot of the computer or uses equipment like audio jacks, microphones then opt for inexpensive hooks to hang them. From sleek single-occupant nooks to a fully equipped secretary style models, there is an array of built-in desk designs to keep you working with endless ease. A right built-in desk will keep you in good stead with style, no matter the task at hand.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>A Pinch Of Motivation For Peaceful Study</h3>
                <img src="std-3.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>Where do you normally work? If the answer is lying on your bed with a laptop munching on crisps, then you might want to reconsider revamping your study space. The time you spend on your work should be conducive. To achieve your goal, hang a motivational board, pictures, and messages to give you a booster shot of inspiration. Daily reminder of your goals and dreams are a great starting point! You can be absolutely creative, colourful or laid back. Install a blackboard where you can scribble motivational quotes to stay inspired. Build an aura in your study room that will bring you closer to achieving your goals.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>A Bookwheel Is Cool And A Space Saver Too</h3>
                <img src="std-4.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>If you’re seeking a clever way to declutter and organise your mountain of prized books, do it in a unique manner. A book wheel lends an interesting look to your study room and creates more than enough storage room. A pile of books, paper, clothing or other items will affect your ability to study. As a matter of fact, it will change your mood from studying to cleaning. Decluttering and re-organising your space will help you eliminate distractions before you dedicate your time and energy to studying. Thus a book wheel in your study room will help you achieve the same.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Don’t Study In The Dark</h3>
                <img src="std-5.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>Good lighting is an essential feature for study rooms. Never study or work in a dimly-lit room as it encourages sleep. Make sure the lights in your study are bright enough to clearly read books or work on your computer without extra effort be it morning, noon or night. A stylish table lamp can fit any specifications for both functionality and style. Consider adding LED lamps on your desk to brighten things up. You can opt for pendant lighting because of its flexibility and contemporary aesthetics. It gives you direct light and is sturdy as it’s fastened to the ceiling. It saves spaces on your desk for that pile of books you wanted to read.</p>

                <h3>DIY Study Rooms: Big On Design, Low On Budgets</h3>
                <img src="std-6.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>If there’s one space in the home children just don’t like getting into often, they are study rooms. Study rooms are generally functional and designed for a specific purpose. They may or may not be a part of every home interior design. But for families with kids, a well thought out study room design can get them to be disciplined, orderly, calm and finish homework on schedule. If a DIY study room hasn’t been a part of your thought or you didn’t grow up with one, you’re not alone! Most of us used temporary spaces such as the dining table, coffee table and more for study when we were kids. But just imagine the peace such a space will entitle you as a parent? Here are a few study room interior design ideas that will ensure you have your home to yourself while kids have theirs too.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Study Nooks Hidden Away In Small Spaces</h3>
                <img src="std-7.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>What defines a small space? Is it an empty one around the house or an unused area? Small spaces can be anywhere, generally where you know nothing much is happening. An awkward space atop your staircase or a corner area where no chair or seating fits in can be used as a study room in the house. With some DIY hacks, a few basic tools and ingenuity, a bookshelf and table can be reconfigured into an L-shaped workspace. Cordon off the area with a bookshelf and attach it to a table using L-shaped brackets. Here you can create a discrete area complete with electric sockets, wall hangings and more. Cover the back of the bookshelf with a chalkboard or pegboard to make it into a wall. Nail baskets to the side of it to carry stationery, stack books, and files for easy access. There are many different things that can be done to complete the study. The lack of a separation wall or makeshift divider should not be a deterrent.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Loft-Bed Combo Study To Keep It All Together</h3>
                <img src="std-8.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>The best way to build a study is to have it under the sleeping area. Most children love the idea of a loft bed and this also uses bedroom space efficiently. While not all loft beds have this setup, you can specially create one to have a bed up while below is the seating and homework area. Bunk beds optimise space, are better to maintain and do away with the need for separate sleeping/study spaces. They are often created for two-child families but isn’t this idea so much fun for single-child ones as well? In case you have a double-decker loft bed bought from a store, you can get rid of the lower part and convert it into a study.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Study Nooks That Keep Kids Engaged</h3>
                <img src="std-9.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>When there are two kids, there’s often mayhem especially with both wanting separate spaces for themselves. This will be quite a task when it comes to multiple kids. In order to achieve the best study room design with such cases, especially if you want to homeschool or need dedicated activity spaces, multiple study areas are great. Take a long table and create shelves beneath them. Or occupy one wall and stack cabinets on the wall for each kid. You can choose to add seating as well as individual chairs for the study room. You can also use benches, pegboards on the wall and makeshift cabinetry beneath. When you DIY, the possibilities are endless. From colour choices to material for furniture, accessories and more, study nooks for multiple kids are a whole lot of fun!</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Built-In Study Spaces That Resemble Alice In Wonderland</h3>
                <img src="std-10.jpg" alt="img">
                <p>Seen the movie Alice in Wonderland where the little girl falls into a hole surrounded by all things nice? You can make this same wonderland for your child at a much lower cost in one such study room idea. Use your creativity to craft a built-in study space. One that feels like a hidden nook, built into a window, at the end of corridors or even in the bedroom with partitions surrounding it. Although this needs a slightly larger budget, a built-in study room can be designed and hidden away in a jiffy. Fit in a sliding bench with castors that can be pulled out or hidden away after use. This is one cheap study room idea. Bookshelves backed with cork boards can be stacked on the walls. Chalkboard paint can create a surface where kids can doodle away. Use a pegboard that can be removed or added to walls at will. Sliding cabinets even provide storage. Basically built-in study nooks can be put up and dismantled anywhere and used according to convenience.</p>
